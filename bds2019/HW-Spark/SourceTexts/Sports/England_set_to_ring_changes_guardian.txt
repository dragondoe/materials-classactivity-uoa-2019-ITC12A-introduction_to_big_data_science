England set to ring changes and rest Jos Buttler for third Pakistan ODI England continue to shuffle their pack during preparations for the World Cup, which have gone well for all but Alex Hales. The team have been tested in all three of their international games but have won them all. Now they are in Bristol, a venue that offers mixed memories. The precise composition of the XI for the third ODI against Pakistan is unclear but one thing is certain: the squad will not be winding down at the Mbargo nightclub afterwards. Jofra Archer and Adil Rashid are almost certain to be missing – neither practised on Monday – and it is likely Jos Buttler will be keeping his powder dry, which would enable Jonny Bairstow to have an outing with the gloves. It is hard to keep track but, though Bairstow is now reinstated as the Test keeper, he is the reserve in the ODI squad. The expectation is Joe Denly may take the place of Buttler at a ground that is now so small that Eoin Morgan is reluctant to play more than one specialist spinner – Bristol used to be one of the largest grounds in the country until the developers set to work. Morgan may opt for an extra bowler, which makes sense on several levels. Much is often made about the depth of England’s batting but this applies only if those players are in some sort of form. One of the goals over the next fortnight must be to ensure Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Archer have some batting time. Jason Roy is bound to play. So, too, is Morgan, who will become England’s most capped ODI cricketer. Roy made 87 at Southampton, which would satisfy most batsmen, but he was hardly ecstatic about that innings. “OK is the right word,” he said. “I was not quite myself. There was certainly a bit of rustiness there.” Still, 87 is not a bad return when a little short of form. Even better, the back spasms have disappeared. “The back actually feels way better than before,” Roy said. “I should have had the injection earlier. There are absolutely no worries at all now.” There was one shot at Southampton, an extra cover drive off Faheem Ashraf that went for six, that was a mini-turning point, which is often the way. One shot can transform a batsman’s confidence. Roy was asked whether he had ever hit a ball more sweetly. “No. That’s as good as it gets. Sorry, lads. I’ve played that shot before and maybe got out a couple of times. I guess it was just instinct. I was struggling a little bit and then it was nice to get one out of the sweet spot and I felt good from there.” The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Roy is looking to capitalise in Bristol but, like most of the England team, he is wary of looking too far ahead. The armchair strategists wonder whether he could have an impact on the Ashes series. He would like to but said: “My focus is on tomorrow and the rest of this series so that I’m in the right state mentally and physically. The weight of runs will come hopefully and, if the [Ashes] call comes, then brilliant.” England are confident Jimmy Anderson has not sustained any long-term damage after limping out of Lancashire’s Royal London Cup defeat by Hampshire on Sunday. The paceman is “a little sore” after being struck on the knee by a straight drive.
